## Prerequisites

You should have Java 11, mvn (maven), node and npm executables in the path.

You also need Postman/SoapUI to invoke the Rest API to create DB entries.

All other tools should be listed in devDependencies section of package.json so they can be installed into the local node_modules (and node_modules/.bin) by simply doing npm install.

## Clone Github project

1. Clone repo using `git clone https://github.com/jrcampos358/project-checkpoint.git`
2. Move to directory: `cd project-checkpoint`. 
3. Open 2 comandline to run both web and microservice. 

## Prepare and Run Microservice 

1. Go to your 1st open terminal (assuming you are in folder 'project-checkpoint')
2. Move to 'micro' directory: `cd micro`

Note: This micro service run on port 8080

3. Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` to start microservice

## Add entries to the inmemory DB

The current state of the app only allow you to insert 'entries' into the H2 database via the REST API.

### To add 'checkppoints' to a project, use the following test data 

Asusmptions : 

In a real world app, 'projectId' will be the container of checkpoints. As I have not provided a UI to be able to create the Project, we will use 

projectId of "8dd5f315-9788-4d00-87bb-10eed9eff566"

Please refer the attached 'screencapture' on how to enter this entries in H2 DB via REST API.



URI : 

http://localhost:8080/checkpoint


HTTP Method : 

POST

Content-Type : 

application/json

Sample Payload : Body Raw

{
   "name":"Design",
   "projectId":"8dd5f315-9788-4d00-87bb-10eed9eff566"
}



Sample Response : 

{
    "id": "9f20460f-3278-4485-8035-ec3b88a0b29b",
    "name": "Design",
    "projectId": "8dd5f315-9788-4d00-87bb-10eed9eff566",
    "complPercentage": 0,
    "tasks": []
}


NOTE : 

The value of the 'id' from the above response will be used to create the 'checkpoint' Tasks. This id will be used for the REST API were going to use.


### To add 'tasks' to a checkpoints, use the following test data 



URI : 

http://localhost:8080/task


HTTP Method : 

POST

Content-Type : 

application/json


Sample Payload : Body Raw

{
         "text":"Recent updates 1",
         "complPercentage":40,
         "checkpointId": "9f20460f-3278-4485-8035-ec3b88a0b29b"
}



Sample Response : 

{
    "id": "a5840f93-7a59-4595-9d35-8529989ef2be",
    "text": "Recent updates 1",
    "complPercentage": 40,
    "checkpointId": "9f20460f-3278-4485-8035-ec3b88a0b29b"
}


NOTE : 

The value of the 'id' from the above response will be used to create the 'checkpoint' Tasks. So you will need




## Prepare and Run Web 

1. Go to your 2nd open terminal (assuming you are in folder 'project-checkpoint')
2. Move to 'web' directory: `cd web`
3. Run `npm install` for installing dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start web app

Note: This webapp run on port 3000

This will open a browser (preferably Chrome) and the list of 'project checkpoints and their tasks will be displayed.'
